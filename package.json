	"description": "The three chatbots present on the webpage are three scripts connected and created in DialogFlow, with all the logic, natural language processing, intents and entities of the conversations created there. The main focus in splitting the chatbots into three levels of complexity. The first starts with a basic knowledge, meaning that it can have a conversation with the human using small chat, and answering to FAQ using Natural Language Processing. The second level is a intermediate complexity chatbot that is capable of handling a more difficult conversation with the human and also is capable of using third party applications of api's, based on the bussiness needs. The last and more complex chatbot includes all the cappabilities of the previous two, but also is capable of using third party platforms that allow transfering the conversation from and to an human agent, expanding the bussiness capabalities and transfering all the hard work into the automation.",
